## Saudações!

A OWASP Sorocaba é um dos mais de 15 capítulos brasileiros entre os mais de 270 Capítulos ativos em todo o mundo. Nosso objetivo é disseminar a missão da OWASP, trazendo a tona questões sobre segurança da informação para todos possam estar cientes dos verdadeiros perigos da má implementação de sistemas Web.

Serão realizados encontros para que as pessoas possam compartilhar conhecimentos, discutir e aprender sobre segurança de software. A organização também tem muitos projetos ativos nos quais os voluntários podem participar para criar códigos e documentos para a comunidade mundial de segurança.
